# Scroll curtains
This is a simple scroll curtain effect for the web. It's a simple CSS and JS animation that can be used to create a curtain effect when scrolling down a page. It's a simple effect that can be used to create a nice transition between sections of a page. It is inspired by the scroll curtain effect on the [Mollie website](https://www.mollie.com/).
